# 1. Business Understanding

## Problem Statement
Currently, keywords associated with research articles in UNZA journals are not automatically organized or classified. This makes it difficult for researchers, students, and librarians to quickly identify relevant articles or track research trends. A manual process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and limits the usefulness of the institutional repository.

## Business Objectives
The goal of this project is to build a system that can automatically classify keywords from articles into meaningful categories (e.g., *Agriculture, Medicine, Computer Science*).  

From a real-world perspective, success means:
- Improving searchability and retrieval of research articles.
- Helping researchers discover related works faster.
- Supporting administrators in analyzing research output trends at UNZA.

## Data Mining Goals
To achieve the above objectives, we will:
- Build a **classification model** that categorizes article keywords into predefined classes.
- Apply **text preprocessing techniques** (tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF).
- Experiment with **classification algorithms** such as Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees.

## Project Success Criteria
- The model should achieve at least **80% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- The classification results must be **interpretable and consistent** across different domains.
- The system should reduce the time required to organize keywords compared to manual methods.
